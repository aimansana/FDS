How to Draw This in UML Tools:
Actors: Draw actors as stick figures or labeled ovals outside the system boundary (rectangle).
System Boundary: Draw a large rectangle to represent the system boundary.
Use Cases: Inside the system boundary, represent use cases as ovals.
Associations: Use lines to connect actors with their relevant use cases. Solid lines represent associations.
Include/Extend Relationships: If any, show them with arrows indicating the relationship between use cases.
