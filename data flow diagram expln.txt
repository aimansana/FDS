Level 0: Context Diagram (High-level View)
This will provide an overview of how the system interacts with the external entities.

Entities:
Farmers: Users who register and submit fertilizer requests.
Officers: Different levels of officers (Field, Junior, Senior, Quality Control, Subsidy Payment).
Admin: System administrator for managing accounts and system-wide functionalities.
Data Flows:
Farmers:

Submit fertilizer requests.
View status of requests.
Track subsidy payments.
View their profile details and land details.
Officers:

Handle farmer registration (Field Officers).
Approve/Reject fertilizer requests (Junior Officers).
Allocate stock (Senior Officers).
Perform quality control inspections (Quality Control Officers).
Manage subsidy payments (Subsidy Payment Officers).
Admin:

Manage officer and farmer accounts.
Monitor system-wide analytics.
Level 1: Process Breakdown (Details of Processes)
Farmers Module:

Registration: Farmers provide personal details and land information through the system.
Request Submission: Farmers submit requests for subsidized fertilizer.
Track Status: Farmers check the status of their fertilizer request.
View Payment Status: Farmers can check if subsidy payments are pending or completed.
Officer Modules (Field Officer, Junior Officer, Senior Officer, Quality Control Officer, Subsidy Payment Officer):

Field Officer:
Registers farmers and land details.
Verifies the farmer's request and submits it for approval.
Junior Officer:
Reviews, approves, or rejects fertilizer requests based on eligibility.
Sends approved requests for stock allocation.
Senior Officer:
Allocates stock to Junior Officers based on demand.
Monitors request statistics and trends via an analytics dashboard.
Manages escalations.
Quality Control Officer:
Conducts quality checks on fertilizers and records inspection results.
Ensures that fertilizer quality meets standards.
Subsidy Payment Officer:
Processes subsidy payments to eligible farmers.
Tracks and manages pending and completed payments.
Admin Module:

Manages user accounts (farmers and officers).
Monitors overall system statistics and analytics.
Level 2: Data Flow Breakdown
For this level, we will show the processes in more detail, specifying the flow of information between different entities.

DFD Representation (Level 2 Breakdown):
Entities:

Farmers
Officers
Admin
System
Processes:

Farmer Registration & Request Submission:

Farmers submit personal details and land information via Field Officer interface.
The Field Officer verifies this data and forwards requests for fertilizer.
Request Approval:

Junior Officer reviews the request data, checks eligibility, and either approves or rejects the request.
The status of the request is updated and sent back to the Farmer's dashboard.
Stock Allocation:

Senior Officer allocates stock based on approved requests from Junior Officers.
Junior Officers receive the stock allocation and ensure it’s delivered to Field Officers for final distribution to farmers.
Quality Assurance:

Quality Control Officers inspect fertilizer stock, filling out quality control surveys and uploading results to the system.
Subsidy Payment Processing:

Subsidy Payment Officers review farmer eligibility, verify delivery completion, and process payments to farmers.
This data is updated in the system, which can be accessed by Admin and other officers.
Data Flows:

Farmers submit requests, track statuses, and view payment statuses through the system.
Officers access and update data according to their roles (approve requests, allocate stock, process quality checks, or payments).
Admin manages data for all users, monitors statistics, and maintains system-wide functionalities.
DFD Structure:
Level 0 Diagram (High-Level Context):

External Entities: Farmers, Officers, Admin.
System: Subsidized Fertilizer Distribution Management System.
Data Flows:
Farmers interact with the system to submit requests, view statuses, and track payments.
Officers interact with the system to verify, approve/reject, allocate stock, perform quality checks, and process payments.
Admin manages accounts, data, and system-wide functionality.
Level 1 Diagram (Process Breakdown):

Farmer Registration & Request:

Request Management:
Junior Officer → System (approve/reject request)
System → Senior Officer (stock allocation)
Senior Officer → System (allocate stock)
System → Junior Officer → Field Officer → Farmer (stock distribution)
Quality Control:
Quality Control Officer → System (upload surveys)
Subsidy Payment:
Subsidy Payment Officer → System (verify eligibility and process payments)
System → Farmer (payment notification)
This Data Flow Diagram serves as a high-level outline of how the system processes the data, from farmer registration to subsidy payment. For a more specific and detailed flow, each of these modules and sub-modules can be represented in a deeper level of DFDs depending on the system's implementation.
